collection: publications
permalink: /publication/IJGIS-2018
excerpt: 'This study developed a spatial dynamic model to examine the coupled natural–human responses in the form of changes in population and associated developed land area in the Lower Mississippi River Basin region. The goal was to identify key socioeconomic factors (utility) and environmental factors (hazard damages, elevation, and subsidence rate) that aﬀected population changes, as well as to examine how population changes aﬀected the local utility and the local environment reciprocally.
